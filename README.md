# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This project uses a logistic regression model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The model has been deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input passenger features and receive a prediction on their likelihood of survival.

## Files
- **`app.py`**: The Streamlit application for making predictions.
- **`logistic_regression_model.pkl`**: The trained logistic regression model.
- **`scaler.pkl`**: The scaler used for preprocessing the input features.
- **`Logistic Regression.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, and model evaluation.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of required Python packages.
